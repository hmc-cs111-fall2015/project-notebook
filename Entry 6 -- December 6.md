# Design notebook for week ending November 30, 2014

## Description

**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.

It wasn't easy but setting are now a part of calendarscript (probably will
be renamed to rcalscript). I won't write about it too much since it is 
already up on the wiki here: https://github.com/aputman/calendarscript/wiki/Settings
.

Basically users can define how the want to write dates and times, and the regex
that interprets the DSL changes based on their definitions. The Settings class
was also built up so that it is ready for more complex and interpreter changing
settings. 


## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**
