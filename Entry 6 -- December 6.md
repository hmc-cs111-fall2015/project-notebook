# Design notebook for week ending November 30, 2014

## Description

### Suggestions

The user can now ask for suggested applications of a construction in the GREPL.
An example that will show you possible circles:

```
Construct $ :s circle
```

This also works with constructions that the user has included.

It would be cool to expand this feature to get information about the
constructions available, to search across both parameter and construction space
simultaneously and then do better filtering out what results you care about.

### Logo

There's a logo. It is just the word construct in a geometric font, with the
beginning of the word having a construction background.

I like its elegance, I like the way in which it shows how constructions can be
used to draw cool things, and how you can use abstraction to obscure the
details when you want.

### Undo

The GREPL has an undo command, `:u` or `:undo`, which undoes the last statement
entered.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

Welp, this is the end. I think I would like to write better compiler into LaTeX

I would like to replace `new` with a better way of excluding items from a set.

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

All good :). I'll appreciate any feedback.

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

8hrs outside?
