# Design notebook for week ending December 6, 2015

## Description

* This week I continued to work on the language design and where the language  _potentially_ could go.
* Put together the presentation for our class presentations
* Not all of my work is complete, but the remainder will go in my final write up since there is no notebook entry next week

## Questions

* How would you expand the language?

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**
