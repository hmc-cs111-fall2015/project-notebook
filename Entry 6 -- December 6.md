# Design notebook for week ending November 30, 2014

## Description

I finished up my project this week! That involved a lot of work, and a lot of testing and error checking but I'm finally getting it to a point that I like. I've implemented a tiered system of constraint imposition in order to simulate weighted constraints, and updated my prepass function to allow for spaces in names (although when it spits out the names later, it does so with no spaces which is kind of annoying but I can't seem to fix.)

I really struggled to get a result from the back end at all and then manpiulating the data and formatting the answer was really hard. Now that I'm there, though, I'm having a great time improving the functionality and working on how to return my results.

## Questions
