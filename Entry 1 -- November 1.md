# Design notebook for week ending November 2, 2014

## Description

* Completed project plan
* Fleshed out project idea and implmentation details
* Unsure about which language to go with, but I think I will stick to Scala for the data model and parser
* I am looking forward to building out an API for the intermediate representation

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

* The most pressing issue is deciding which features I should prioritize in the data model.
* Trying to design an API in the intermediate representation so that implmenting the language features of the front-end later seems like a daunting task. I think a lot of planning will go into this week separate from the implmentation.

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

* How did you approach building an intermediate representaion?
* What language are you using and why? (I think I can answer this partially in the critique, but I would love to hear suggestions).
* 

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

* 1-2 hours writing out what my goals for this project are (in terms of final product and personal goals)
* 2-3 hours thinking through a plan for the next few weeks
* 3-4 hours writing up and rewriting the plan details trying to flesh out how to approach next week.
* 2-3 hours in studio/class time on this project
* 0-1 hours writing up this notebook
