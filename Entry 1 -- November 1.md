# Design notebook for week ending November 1, 2014

## Description

I worked on figuring out some specifics of what the language's features would be this week. After some discussion, I decided to replace specifying ingredients by exact quantity to specifying them by weight (though it seems like this will have its own set of issues too!). I also spent some time thinking about how to structure the project so that it would be easily readable, and planning out the rest of the semester so I could measure my actual vs expected progress.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

The most pressing thing to do now is to actually start implementing the language, and figuring out key elements in the basic language implementation - for instance, how to allow users to define their own procedures (the lecture in class today made clear that it's not an easy task) and how to organize the key data that the language needs to function.

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

I think that the design decisions that I make now (before I start writing code) will drastically affect the final outcome of the language. If my critique partners could weigh in with their thoughts on these decisions, I would greatly appreciate it. 
 
**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

Not that much time, to be honest. (Maybe 6 or so hours?) I only really figured out what I wanted the language to look like on Wednesday. I've spent most of my project time this week trying to get a feel of what the overall structure of the language would need to look like to get the features that I want in it.
