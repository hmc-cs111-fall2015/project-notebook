# Design notebook for week ending November 2, 2014

## Description

**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.

Starting last thursday I have been extremely sick and pretty much unable to think about anything having to do with school. I'm just now starting to recover which is great! 

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

There is a seriously pressing issue for my project: How am I going to handle the constraint solver for the back end logic of my program? I think that I will want to use Scala to Parse and handle the IR but the Scala constraint solvers I have found are a lot worse than prolog, does it make sense to try to use a prolog interpreter in Scala? Or should I just use the constraint solver?


**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

How do I handle constraints that are not necessarily hard requirements? 

If nothing fills my constraints, is there a way to get the best option?

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

I did not get to spend as much time as I was going to on my project this week because I have been (still am) very sick and locked to my bed. I probbaly have spent 3-5 hours + class time last week on my assignment including today and yesterday (which should be next week!)
