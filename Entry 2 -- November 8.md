# Design notebook for week ending November 9, 2014

## Description

#### Wednesday November 4
Today I was thinking a lot about how I wanted to attack my project. My default plan is a parser and constraint solving library in Scala but I also think thats not very sexy. Prof Ben set me up to have a meeting with Prof Keller on Friday where Im gonna learn about the possiblity of an internal DSL in _prolog_.

When I was thinking about kinda whacky solutions to my problem, though I got the idea to try and do something in [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/). I spent a long time getting back into it and I think it is a possibility but there isnt really a great infrastructure for doing constraint/logic programming. I think that, while I want to make Mathematica work because I think its awesome, Mathematica is _probably_ not the answer here. :(

#### Thursday November 5
Thinking more about my possibilities I'm becoming more resigned to the necessecity of an external DSL in Scala which, while I might not think is as _cool_ as some other options I'm considering, is probably a good solution. I'm still waiting to see what is said about internal DSLs in prolog but its seeming unlikely that I go that route.

Today its also been good for me to try and do some constraint programming in Prolog just to see what it feels like, try and make sure I can get the solutions I think I should get based on constraints I set myself. Basically I want to be able to make sure that I can use constraint solvers to do the same logic my brain does, (on a scale that is small enought hat my brain can contain the whole problem) so I can trust it to do larger computations once my brain can't contain the whole problem (the whole reason I'm doing this project ;))

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**
