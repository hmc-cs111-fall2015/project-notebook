# Design notebook for week ending November 9, 2014

## Description

#### Wednesday November 4
Today I was thinking a lot about how I wanted to attack my project. My default plan is a parser and constraint solving library in Scala but I also think thats not very sexy. Prof Ben set me up to have a meeting with Prof Keller on Friday where Im gonna learn about the possiblity of an internal DSL in _prolog_.

When I was thinking about kinda whacky solutions to my problem, though I got the idea to try and do something in [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/). I spent a long time getting back into it and I think it is a possibility but there isnt really a great infrastructure for doing constraint/logic programming. I think that, while I want to make Mathematica work because I think its awesome, Mathematica is _probably_ not the answer here. :(

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**
