# Design notebook for week ending November 25, 2015

## Description

My main accomplishment these past few days was figuring out how to change the `Decision` class
to account for the fact that either branch could end with a terminal node
that shouldn't converge with the other branch.
The main problem is that originally the `nextNode` for `Decision` refers to the node
on which both branches converge, but this makes the erroneous assumption
that both branches converge. To account for this error when creating the visual flowchart,
under this structure at least, `Decision` needs to know whether either branch contains a terminal node,
which is information that I don't think is appropriate for `Decision` to either know or compute.
Instead, thanks to my friend Savannah, I'm thinking I'll redefine `Decision`
to just have references to the first node in each branch.
It's then up to the parser to make the branches converge if necessary,
which is a fairly simple task. The thing I like least about this decision
is that `nextNode` needs to be removed from the the abstract class `FlowchartNode`
because it doesn't have an obvious meaning for a `Decision`
which goes to two nodes (the beginning of each branch).
This removal could result in an increase in type checking due to a decrease in conformity.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

I need to change the flowchart abstract syntax to reflect the above changes.

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

Is this decision reasonable? Can you think of a better solution?
I also didn't finish the evaluation in time for my critique last time,
so if you could review that and lend me your thoughts that'd be cool.

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

Probably 4 hours: 1 hour talking with Savannah about the pros and cons of changing the abstract syntax
(we also discussed loops), 1 hour thinking about it on my own,
1 hour thinking about making the flowchart creation part more extensible, 1 hour on notebook.

## Post-critique summary

Dan expressed concerns about my decision to only parse the "main" method,
suggested some syntax changes, and had some questions and comments on the implementation.

## Post-critique reflection

The decision to only parse the "main" method is largely a temporary one
based on the fact that most of the code I'm interested in flowcharting
occurs in the "main" method&mdash;I needed the implementation to have an initial "top-level" context,
so I chose the "main" method. Ideally, users would indicate (perhaps via annotations)
which methods should be flowcharted.

I'm happy _someone_ appreciates my decision to use `Optional`. :relaxed:

The proposed syntax changes for avoiding collisions make sense,
but I'm not yet convinced I want to add the extra burden to users.

The new library for writing flowcharts in DOT (a Graphviz language)
is better than the previous because it offers more support
for writing the flowchart encoding programmatically rather than directly in the DOT language.

I didn't know I was using tabs! After reading that I immediately updated the files to use spaces instead,
and even changed the indentation from 4 to 2 spaces.

Yes, `getMethod` is clunky, but I let it slide since it's hopefully a temporary solution.

[DOT] is the Graphviz language that is best suited to generating flowcharts.
