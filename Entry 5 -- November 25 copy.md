# Design notebook for week ending November 30, 2014

## Description

Sorry, forgot to write this


**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.


I fixed all the major bugs this week and added in the capability to actually
run the program from the command line. The intructions are in the README for 
the project. 

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

Actually, I don't really think there are any pressing issues for the project.
I fixed all the bugs I have found and all there is left to do is allow more 
user features, like user settings and difference syntax options. 

I am currently looking at how to add user features like I wrote about last week. 

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

How would you want to specify settings such as time and date formats that you 
would want to use over the default settings?

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

Not much, probably around 2-3 hours 

## Post-critique summary

Didnt get any. 

## Post-critique reflection
