# Design notebook for week ending November 30, 2014

## Description

This (short) week I made strides into handling the back end! This is great because to this point I kinda felt like tackling it was an impossible task and now I have a clear idea of how to proceed. I mapped out my strategy in words so I know how to go from task to task, which to me is really valuable. I wrote an encoder and decoder to interface with the constraint solver and now I'm actually handing the constraint solving which is pretty fun! I'm excited to run my first program :)

## Questions

I haven't done a huge amount of work since I was last critiqued so there isn't very much to ask but:

1) How much unit testing are you doing in your projects? How much commenting? I'm wondering because I haven't embarked on this at all and know it may be time consuming and unearth some bugs. When do you plan on doing this?

2) Do you guys feel like someone else could write a program in your language right now?

3) How much work have you guys done on throwing errors for your language?

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

3-5 hours
