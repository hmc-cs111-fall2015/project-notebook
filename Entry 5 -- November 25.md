# Design notebook for week ending November 25, 2015

_This is a short week due to Thanksgiving and this entry will reflect on the project as a whole instead of progress made in a few days_

## Description

**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.

### Important/Exciting milestones:
#### Past:
* Basic AST
* Working API-like design

#### Current:
* Functional parser

#### Future:
* Tying everything together
* Expanding the language
* Error handling language

### Changes to previous decisions:
Originally, I chose to design for just reserving rooms -- and this will be the continuing focus.
However, the language should be able to handle reservations for flight seats, and hotel rooms, among other reservation types as well.
(The question is really -- why not?)

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

The most pressing issue at the moment is bringing the language to a functional state.
Currently, it does not parse queries. The functional portion of the language can be accessed like an API.
This can be fixed by working on the front-end and IR, I will need to work on these section.

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

I do not have specific questions about my project, rather...
* How do you prevent project creep?
* What has helped you the most in the language design process?
* What has been most effective for expanding your language?

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

This is a short week, only a few hours (3)? including studio time.
