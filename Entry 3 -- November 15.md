# Design notebook for week ending November 16, 2014

## Description

**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.


Not much to show since this week was mostly implementing what I have previously 
described. 

Currently I am 99% sure the parser works. There are still a few problems with the
interpreter, but they come from using the ICal4J APIs and dealing with date times.
I don't think this should take too much time. 

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

I don't really know. I mainly spent time implementing this week, not really considering
other aspects of the language.

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

What do you think about the implementation model?

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

I spent around 11-12 hours this week, making up for less time I spent last week on the project.
