# Design notebook for week ending November 22, 2015

## Description

**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.

* I just realized that my understanding of how the AST and Parser should work together (and ultimately how the interpreter works) was fundamentally flawed... Not *too* bad, just have to rewrite the AST.
  * On the bright side, what I thought I had to do was much more complex then what actually needs to be done :-)
  * On the not-so-bright side, I think I would be done with the parser by now if my original understanding was the correct one.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**
